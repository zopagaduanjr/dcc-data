We loved everything we tried!\n\n📍 The cafe is located in a suburb-ish location and occupies a residential lot with a beautiful view of Mount Apo.\n\n👨🏻‍🍳 The owner/barista's passion and love for coffee is evident in every cup they serve, as they offer a selection of classic and inventive coffee drinks. On our first visit, it was during their soft opening, and we had a great conversation with the owner about coffee and art. He was very welcoming and the café itself has a cozy, industrial, and semi-finished vibe that really reflects the items on the menu - exquisite, constantly improving, and innovative.\n\n💵 Accepts cash and Gcash\n\nP.S. It was also the first time I've used the word \"beautiful\" to describe a beverage. (see image below) 😉",

And they’re super nice too!\n\nLoved the place. It had a lot of interesting book and art (always a good sign!) and you can choose the mug you want your drink placed in (which I think they make themselves??)\n\nWe tried the Europa, which is their version of the Spanish latte. (No, the blue thing on top isn’t toothpaste. It’s icing!)\n\nReco: Try drinking the drink without mixing it first.\n\n💰: cash and gcash\n🪑: limited (but there’s a second floor, which we didn’t go to)\n\nI live quite nearby so will definitely be back :)",
