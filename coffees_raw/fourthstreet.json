I probably wouldn't recommend coming here during lunchtime though as the heat from the outside radiates inside.\n\nTheir aesthetic is very clean and minimalistic, which is also translated to their coffee menu as I have a hard time ordering their coffee because of the unusual labeling. In terms of the functionality of the space, it's a bit uncomfortable because of the seats. They don't really have backrests so if your just planning for a quick coffee stop, or if your planning to kill time alone while waiting for your friends or family, then this is the place to go.\n\nAs for their coffee, I ordered their white coffee which I liked as it had the strong coffee flavor which was not overpowered by the milk. My boyfriend ordered their mocha, which was also good. A perfect blend of coffee and chocolate.\n\nWould recommend!",

Instead, we just tried their Spanish Latte and Hot Chocolate. We got to chat with who I presume is the owner and he mentioned that they are a specialty coffee shop. I liked their Spanish Latte, although I would've loved it more if it were a bit stronger. The vibe of the coffee shop is very clean and minimalist. It's perfect to have your morning coffee. They also have a small outdoor area if you want to have more privacy. It's conducive for dates and studying. I would suggest for them to bring back their food items and maybe some desserts to pair with their coffee. And also maybe they need more fans, especially during the summer. Overall, this is one of the top coffee shops that I've tried in Davao who serve well-made coffee.",
